Recipe website project with The Odin Project

6.28.22-
This is my first webpage, outside of "Hello World" as a project with The Odin Project. I learned how to format a webpage in html, how to stylize it with CSS, and in the future will learn how to apply JavaScript to it as well. The project began 6.27.22. It has been a fun and challenging process. I know there is so much more to learn, but accomplishing this and watching it grow in to something better is very rewarding!
